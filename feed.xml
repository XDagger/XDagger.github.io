        **to developers who aspire to develop**


1. Blockground introduction

XDAG take live in 2017 in the bitcointalk community, and is the first digital cryptocurrency based on DAG that can be mined using the PoW algorithm.
The XDAG network came go live in January 2018. There are no ICO, no pre-mining. The block reward is halved every four years. The  total volume is around 1.4 billion.

XDAG is currently being continuously developed and maintained by a group of developers who love blockchain and persist in the ideal of decentralization. 
The goal is to utilize the characteristics 
of DAG technology to create a high-speed, stable, and flexible blockchain technology that supports multiple main stream applications.

2.Technical advantages

1) XDAG is the first public chain based on DAG to realize the PoW.
Combining the high concurrency of DAG with the security and decentralization of POW to solve the “impossible triangle” problem in the blockchain technology;
2) Block = Transaction = Address.
 This unique design ensures that the transfer process will not lose coins due to typing in the wrong address; #### 3) Low transaction fee and high TPS. XDAG uses unique technology to solve many problems that may exist in the blockchain system, such as double-spending, uncontrollable transaction time, centralization, 34% attacks, and 51% attacks.


3.From Apollo Plan to Mars Plan

XDAG was highly respected once it was released, but in the first year of development, its own problems gradually exposed, such as the inability 
of the mining pool to synchronize and other serious problems, which made XDAG unable to continue its original glory.
On the one hand, mining tyrants relied on the cost advantages of FPGA and ASIC mining machines to “dig and sell”; on the other hand, the originalC code is in the low degree 
of engineering which makes programmers daunting.
XDAG entered the “darkest moment”. The low price of the currency and lack of development funds led to the slow development and entered a vicious circle.
At the critical moment in mid-2019, the XDAG community launched the Apollo Project for exploring a development path suitable for XDAG while ensuring the living space of XDAG.
Since that time, the XDAG community governance has gradually been on the right track, and XDAG has shown a good development trend. The release of the Java version is now near 
to complete. The RandomX algorithm upgrade was achieved with a big success, which solves the historical problems of the monopoly reward of mining tyrants and creates a much fair
 environment for participants. 
The RandomX algorithm allows users with ordinary PCs to participate in the mining process and obtain certain rewards easily, which has greatly increased users’ confidence in XDAG.
The success of Apollo’s Plan is not only due to the active maintenance of community developers, but also to the trust of all users in the development potential of XDAG.
The great success of the Apollo project is not only inseparable from the efforts of the XDAG community and fans, but also depends on the era of turbulent cryptocurrency.
 When Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., have set new highs,and Coinbase landed on Nasdaq, the XDAG community launched the Mars project. The project will take XDAG forward a big step 
 on the basis of the achievements of the Apollo project, and open the way for eventually accommodating mainstream blockchain applications.

4. Outline of XDAG Mars Project

The Mars project is divided into four phases:

1. Exploration phase: XDAGJ testnet is online (online, in beta)
1) Construction of testnet: build a testnet with multiple mining pools, at least one C version mining pool and one Java version mining pool;
2) Test coin application: use mining reward distribution, users can mine to obtain test coin; or use issues to apply and distribute regularly;
3) Testnet access tutorial:complete tutorial of testnet mining, including the construction of miners, how to mine and the detailed introduction of miners’ command line;
4) Issues submission specification: the submission of bugs should describe detailed issues for quick analysis and resolution;
5) Blockchain browser: The most intuitive experience for users, you can use the block browser consistent with the official website;
6) Mining algorithm modification: access to RandomX algorithm;
7) Libp2p java version is added.

2. Landing phase: XDAGJ mainnet is online
1) Improve test cases: write test cases for existing functions;
2) Improve the log function: provide a relatively complete log service to facilitate trouble shooting;
3) Solve the various small problems of locally loading data, replace the recursive loading method with a loop to avoid stack overflow;
4) Realize the snapshot function: solve the problem of slow loading speed of the historical main block;
5) Mining function improvement: Consider replacing existing practices with more mature mining protocols, such as Stratum.

3. Expansion phase: XDAGJ smart contract is online
1) Use the Ethereum balance model to transform the data structure, remove the address block, and increase the handling fee;
2) Improve the existing public and private key and address generation methods, use BIPxx and other specifications, use the mnemonic scheme to generate public 
and private key pairs, and replace the wallet.dat method.
3) Lightweight wallet application to build metamask RPC compatible with web3;
4) Implement EVM that supports solidity language and is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts;
5) Remove whitelist.

4. Prosperity Phase: DAG-DEFI Infrastructure Development
1) Join the cross-chain scheme, compatible with the access of multiple blockchains, and realize the intercommunication between other chains and XDAG;
2) Join the oracle;
3) Join a distributed exchange.
The Mars project prioritizes the solution of technical issues that the community cares about. During this period, major research breakthroughs can be flexibly 
added to the development plan.

XDAG Rebranding

As we enter a new phase of development, a member of the community with a certain talent for graphic design has proposed to create a new identity for us as well as a redesign of our publication media (website/social media…).
That’s why we would like to submit to the vote of the community the new graphic identity to adopt for the future, starting with the logo.

There are 6 distinct logos that you can consult in the attached pdf, the first being a rebranding of our current logo, accompanied by 5 other proposals.

For this vote we will again use the wallet system with 1 XDAG = 1 vote, the wallet with the most XDAGs wins.

Here are the 6 wallet addresses, from 1 to 6 according to the order of the pdf.

As warned some days ago, RandomX will go live on our mainnet on main block 1540096 February 22nd 2021, 15:00 UTC .
There will be no changes or manipulations to be made for the users, only the mining pools are concerned.
We will come back to you with an update of the wallets shortly.

Mining changes

As you all know, this change of algo was long overdue to counter the big miners who were taking over the network.
From now on, anyone can mine XDAG, even from his or her desktop computer.
This opens up a wide field of possibilities for mining, and we hope to convince the mining communities of Monero and Firo to join us to strengthen our network.

Technical

We already have a miner ready for use, there are no major changes other than the algo.

This miner does not require files wallet.dat and dnet_key.dat. Storage folder is still necessary.

You can find it at this adress: https://github.com/XDagger/XdagRandomxMiner/releases/tag/v0.4</content><author>

We’ll release a new version and switch to the new algorithm (RandomX) online in the near future.
At the same time, the 300,000 XDAGs from the initial crowdfunding will be awarded to the relevant contributors (https://xdag.io/task#community )

The new algorithm will bring the following advantages to the community:

1. The new algorithm will first support CPU mining, which will solve the problem of XDAG mining fairness.
2. The new algorithm will attract more miners to join as it become easier to mine and the growing team of miners will greatly improve the stability of the XDAG network.

Thank you for the support of the community members, and we wish to all of our Chinese community a happy Chinese New Year and XDAG bullishness!</content><author>

October has been a great month for XDAG community, awesome growth in our Telegram and twitter community.
 We’re glad to have an increased number of community supporters, it’s showing more users and prospects are getting to know and ready to adopt XDAG. 
 We just want you to know that, we appreciate your support and commitment.



Exchange Listing

We’re still in talks with several exchanges so xdag can be listed, since we all know a new exchange is what all our community wants. Hopefully we get good feedback from them.

Technical Update

XDAG’s BIP44 universal code is 586!

Thanks to the efforts of community enthusiasts, XDAG now finally has its own BIP44 cointype 586!

So what is the BIP44? Why does XDAG need BIP44?
 To understand BIP44 we have to mention the HD wallet. Since there are so many cryptocurrencies nowadays and they are not easy to manage when one user has too many private keys, the HD wallet was created, and its function is that one master private key can generate multiple sub-private keys, that is, one HD wallet can be used to manage multiple cryptocurrency accounts and only one master private key needs to be backed up, and when the user has multiple blockchain assets (BTC, ETH, XDAG, etc.), the user can manage them in one HD wallet, this is much more convenient. 
BIP44 is the standard private key management protocol used by HD wallets, XDAG has now joined the BIP44 protocol with a common standard code so that HD wallets can support the management of XDAG address accounts.

Obtaining this standard code will facilitate further alignment of XDAG with BTC and ETH, which has many potential benefits for the future development of XDAG:

  Enables multi-chain wallets to support XDAG
  Enables XDAG to back up private key files using mnemonics.
  Facilitate professional teams to manage XDAG wallet hierarchically.


RandomX

Random X development is done, when it is fully reviewed we are going to launch it with the next update.



Briefly let talk about the “October effect” Bitcoin’s apparent effect has given more impression to still be the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and daily trading volume. 
Xdag also hit a new ATH price up too in the month of October, which is a very great edge for the community, we’re almost there, it’s only a matter of time XDAG adoption will surely be global.

We remain committed, focused and as a community project with you all continuous support we’re going to have the XDAG of our dream.</content><author>
