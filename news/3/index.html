XDAG is based on DAG

XDAG is a novel application of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology that solves the issues currently facing blockchain technology.

The DAG chain and XDAG has numerous benefit that makes it unique, suitable for everyone around the world more than a blockchain based cryptocurrency.


A brief explanation of what DAG is about.

What is DAG?

DAG (directed acyclic graph) is a directed graph with no directed cycles, that uses a topological ordering. DAG is an alternative method for sending data amongst people within a distributed, decentralized environment. This is done without a blockchain, allowing for greater scalability.

As we all know Dagger is part of a new wave of Distributed Ledger projects based on a DAG infrastructure which directly implies it has numerous benefit using DAG technology on XDAG platform which include the following;

TRANSACTIONAL SPEED

Since XDAG is a DAG-based cryptocurrency it’s capable of handling hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. It increases the speed and stability of transactions as the user network grows. Since the passing of information is not limited to one chain but can be pass in a parallel allowing more than one chain to exist at any time.

INCREASE RELIABILITY

The mechanism of multiple transaction confirmation in cryptocurrencies based on DAG allows to increase the reliability of payments and reduce the chance of “double spending” 
Since the DAG network only need verification of two close nodes this will surely ensures the reduction of costs for all users on the network.

DECENTRALIZED

XDAG is the decentralized and first minable DAG cryptocurrency, which has technology’s sequential solution and increased efficiency.
Block = transaction = address
Original main chain idea
Mining new money every 64 seconds. XDAG is both CPU &amp; GPU mineable.

SECURITY

The multi-point connections of DAG technology’s logic ensures that tampering with records is impossible. XDAG is working on incorporating more privacy features in the future.

FRIENDLY ECOSYSTEM

DAG-chain transactions are conducted without any physical mining and are therefore far more energy efficient. That’s because every transaction is validated by the transaction itself, cutting costs to network users as well as cutting down on energy consumption.

Lastly scalability and prompt timing on the execution of smart contract, also makes DAG network very beneficial to XDAG platform and we know we’re the future of cryptocurrency.

XDAG community has new team members who are goal driven to help achieve great success in the project. Together we’ll be taking XDAG to it’s next level.

XDAG prices surge
XDAG has finally done it, since the time it was launched on Coinmarketcap. The asset rocketed past it usual price for the first time since it been added to CMC, reaching a massive upward surge. 
This was a 36% jump from where the cryptocurrency was trading. We look forward for more surges in days to come.

Exchange listing

Currently we’re still in talks with different exchanges on how XDAG will be listed on them, we hope to see a more positive feedback from them, just stay tuned for more information about our new listing.

Lastly we are open to collaboration and opportunity that will be strategic to help move XDAG to the next level. Within this opportunity lies the very reality of demand. But sure we’re ready for what is ahead in the XDAG ecosystem.

                            XDAG Project Briefing
Issue 1, 2020

XDAGers, we meet again.

The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 hit the “pause button” for many economic activities, but the pace of XDAG’s progress was not interrupted. After completing the production cuts, enthusiasts are pressing on with the Apollo program. Recent development has been around the RocksDB storage revamp, with a new version to be released after testing is complete.

RocksDB version introduction

Historical Issues:

For historical reasons, the node needs to reload data into memory every time it reboots, rebooting the node takes at least 20+ hours (before version 0.3.1, it took about 7 days to reboot), and takes up a lot of memory, hard disk, etc. The problem is a serious constraint on the expansion of community consensus.

In response to this issue, the community has completed development work on the RocksDB version, resolving the reload issue:


  Data will be written into RocksDB from memory;
  Drastically reduce the memory consumption of the mining pool (about 300M).
  The full-node wallet (mining pool) reload time is reduced to seconds.

Recent works

Development work
Completed coding of RocksDB version with heavy workload, now submitted PR (https://github.com/XDagger/xdag/pull/570); Bill and swordlet released new version of Android wallet and PC wallet, with support for transaction note function; discussed and identified new mining algorithm as RandomX.

Testing work
Bill built the testing framework and did a lot of testing on the RocksDB version, and kbs1 will join the testing work soon.

Community operation
Co-working with BBX exchange to carry out four activities of XDAG; lunch on QB.COM exchange and start on board activities simultaneously.

Follow-up works

Daniel, the founder of XDAG, has vowed to create a fair system of cryptocurrency based on DAG technology, which the community has been aiming for. The core idea of the Apollo program is to complete the implementation of the “equity” feature of XDAG, the community will follow the implementation steps of RocksDB -&gt; modify mining algorithm -&gt; dnet refactoring -&gt; de-whitelist to achieve this goal.


  RocksDB to address reloading issues


See introduction above.


  Mining algorithms to address mining equity issues


The old versions: SHA256D mining algorithm, which has a large number of professional mining machines, has led to a concentration of hash power in the hands of few people, which is far from the “fairness” that the community seeks, the adoption of a fair algorithm is the voice of the entire XDAG community.

New version: using the Random X algorithm, featuring anti-professional mining machines, and optimized specifically for general-purpose CPUs, mining is more decentralized and fairness.


  dnet refactoring


Adopts libuv (underlying technology of node.js) to reconstruct P2P network transmission, ensuring stable and efficient transmission

Older versions: messy dnet code, complex multi-threaded logic.

New version: libuv event loop rebuilds the core P2P network code to ensure stability and reliability while enhancing future scalability.


  Optimize network transmission and remove whitelisting


Older versions: too many bytes transferred over the network, too long synchronization time, severe centralization.

New version
Optimizes the data structure of the network transmission, reduces the network communication bandwidth, and plans to adopt DHT network distributed hash tables, completely removing whitelisting restrictions.


The XDAG fans are never gone, the pace of progress never stops, and XDAG is destined to continue the road to decentralization and eventually reach the “other side” of fairness…

Thank you to Bill, Swordlet, kbs1, the many contributors who have been quietly contributing, and to you who are following XDAG!

Postscript

The year 2020 is an extraordinary one, with the new coronavirus ravaging the world, accumulating about 2 million confirmed cases as of April 15, causing great impact and loss to human society. Humans are also so small in the face of viruses. Here, we pray for the blessings for the world to quickly win this epidemic war!

                            XDAG Project Briefing
Issue 1, 2020

XDAGers, we meet again.

The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 hit the “pause button” for many economic activities, but the pace of XDAG’s progress was not interrupted. After completing the production cuts, enthusiasts are pressing on with the Apollo program. Recent development has been around the RocksDB storage revamp, with a new version to be released after testing is complete.

RocksDB version introduction

Historical Issues

For historical reasons, the node needs to reload data into memory every time it reboots, rebooting the node takes at least 20+ hours (before version 0.3.1, it took about 7 days to reboot), and takes up a lot of memory, hard disk, etc. The problem is a serious constraint on the expansion of community consensus.

In response to this issue, the community has completed development work on the RocksDB version, resolving the reload issue:


  Data will be written into RocksDB from memory;
  Drastically reduce the memory consumption of the mining pool (about 300M).
  The full-node wallet (mining pool) reload time is reduced to seconds.

Recent works

Development work
Completed coding of RocksDB version with heavy workload, now submitted PR (https://github.com/XDagger/xdag/pull/570); Bill and swordlet released new version of Android wallet and PC wallet, with support for transaction note function; discussed and identified new mining algorithm as RandomX.

Testing work
Bill built the testing framework and did a lot of testing on the RocksDB version, and kbs1 will join the testing work soon.

Community operation
Co-working with BBX exchange to carry out four activities of XDAG; lunch on QB.COM exchange and start on board activities simultaneously.

Follow-up works

Daniel, the founder of XDAG, has vowed to create a fair system of cryptocurrency based on DAG technology, which the community has been aiming for. The core idea of the Apollo program is to complete the implementation of the “equity” feature of XDAG, the community will follow the implementation steps of RocksDB -&gt; modify mining algorithm -&gt; dnet refactoring -&gt; de-whitelist to achieve this goal.


  RocksDB to address reloading issues


See introduction above.


  Mining algorithms to address mining equity issues


The old versions: SHA256D mining algorithm, which has a large number of professional mining machines, has led to a concentration of hash power in the hands of few people, which is far from the “fairness” that the community seeks, the adoption of a fair algorithm is the voice of the entire XDAG community.

New version: using the Random X algorithm, featuring anti-professional mining machines, and optimized specifically for general-purpose CPUs, mining is more decentralized and fairness.


  dnet refactoring


Adopts libuv (underlying technology of node.js) to reconstruct P2P network transmission, ensuring stable and efficient transmission

Older versions: messy dnet code, complex multi-threaded logic.

New version: libuv event loop rebuilds the core P2P network code to ensure stability and reliability while enhancing future scalability.


  Optimize network transmission and remove whitelisting


Older versions: too many bytes transferred over the network, too long synchronization time, severe centralization.

New version
Optimizes the data structure of the network transmission, reduces the network communication bandwidth, and plans to adopt DHT network distributed hash tables, completely removing whitelisting restrictions.



The XDAG fans are never gone, the pace of progress never stops, and XDAG is destined to continue the road to decentralization and eventually reach the “other side” of fairness…

Thank you to Bill, Swordlet, kbs1, the many contributors who have been quietly contributing, and to you who are following XDAG!

Postscript

The year 2020 is an extraordinary one, with the new coronavirus ravaging the world, accumulating about 2 million confirmed cases as of April 15, causing great impact and loss to human society. Humans are also so small in the face of viruses. Here, we pray for the blessings for the world to quickly win this epidemic war!

                            XDAG Apollo First Upgrade Announcement
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Hello dear community members, on September 15th, the community officially adopted every detail of the Apollo plan. The plan has now entered the implementation stage, a series of optimization and upgrades will be carried out on XDAG to achieve the expected goals.

Recently the community wanted to solve the problem of long reloading time before production reduction, however, due to the huge workload of code adjustment, now we are going to change the work plan to implement production reduction along with solving reload issue when upgrading the system.

The community will carry out the first upgrade as planned, detailed steps are:

A. The production reduction time:
January 30, 2020  00: 00 (UTC)

B. The upgrade content:

  Reduce each block reward from 1024 XDAG to 128 XDAG.
  Enable RPC.


C. Coordination matters:
All mining pools should complete the upgrade of the new version (0.3.1) before January 30, 2020.
