The community is happy to announce that according to the Apollo program planning, after the developer’s unremitting efforts, the new mining algorithm of XDAG is now ready.
We’ll release a new version and switch to the new algorithm (RandomX) online in the near future.
At the same time, the 300,000 XDAGs from the initial crowdfunding will be awarded to the relevant contributors (https://xdag.io/task#community )

The new algorithm will bring the following advantages to the community:

1. The new algorithm will first support CPU mining, which will solve the problem of XDAG mining fairness.
2. The new algorithm will attract more miners to join as it become easier to mine and the growing team of miners will greatly improve the stability of the XDAG network.

Thank you for the support of the community members, and we wish to all of our Chinese community a happy Chinese New Year and XDAG bullishness!

We’re Almost There!

October has been a great month for XDAG community, awesome growth in our Telegram and twitter community.
 We’re glad to have an increased number of community supporters, it’s showing more users and prospects are getting to know and ready to adopt XDAG. 
 We just want you to know that, we appreciate your support and commitment.



Exchange Listing

We’re still in talks with several exchanges so xdag can be listed, since we all know a new exchange is what all our community wants. Hopefully we get good feedback from them.

Technical Update

XDAG’s BIP44 universal code is 586!

Thanks to the efforts of community enthusiasts, XDAG now finally has its own BIP44 cointype 586!

So what is the BIP44? Why does XDAG need BIP44?
 To understand BIP44 we have to mention the HD wallet. Since there are so many cryptocurrencies nowadays and they are not easy to manage when one user has too many private keys, the HD wallet was created, and its function is that one master private key can generate multiple sub-private keys, that is, one HD wallet can be used to manage multiple cryptocurrency accounts and only one master private key needs to be backed up, and when the user has multiple blockchain assets (BTC, ETH, XDAG, etc.), the user can manage them in one HD wallet, this is much more convenient. 
BIP44 is the standard private key management protocol used by HD wallets, XDAG has now joined the BIP44 protocol with a common standard code so that HD wallets can support the management of XDAG address accounts.

Obtaining this standard code will facilitate further alignment of XDAG with BTC and ETH, which has many potential benefits for the future development of XDAG:

  Enables multi-chain wallets to support XDAG
  Enables XDAG to back up private key files using mnemonics.
  Facilitate professional teams to manage XDAG wallet hierarchically.


RandomX

Random X development is done, when it is fully reviewed we are going to launch it with the next update.



Briefly let talk about the “October effect” Bitcoin’s apparent effect has given more impression to still be the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and daily trading volume. 
Xdag also hit a new ATH price up too in the month of October, which is a very great edge for the community, we’re almost there, it’s only a matter of time XDAG adoption will surely be global.

We remain committed, focused and as a community project with you all continuous support we’re going to have the XDAG of our dream.

                            Java Version
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            

We’re pleased to officially announce that XDAG has now been implemented in Java, which indeed is a great call for the community, more developer are needed to support this great cause in other to help simplify the difficulty of technology advancement.

Why XDAG choose Java:

We want our community to experience something more different than C, we understand the power behind huge community support and we’re committed to make bigger implementation.

Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)


  
    It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
  
  
    It is easy to learn and simple to use
  
  
    It also an open-source and its free
  
  
    It is secure, fast and powerful
  
  
    Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
  


The above are the reason why  we took advantage of the java version so our community can benefit.

Lastly with the new implementation of XDAG in Java will call out for more developer to join our community. Together we can achieve a lot as a community project.
