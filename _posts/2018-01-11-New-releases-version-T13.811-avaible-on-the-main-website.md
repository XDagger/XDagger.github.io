###### Fixes:
1. trouble with another address fixed (already!). If you run the program again you should obtain the same address.
1. some rebranding done:
   * executable renamed to xdag, xdag.exe and xdagwallet.exe
   * prompt is xdag> now
   * currency token is XDAG
   * log file is xdag.log

Recommended for miners.pool not concerned
