#### iWeb Conference

We are pleased to announce XDAG has taken part in the 2018 iWeb conference held at the Beijing International Convention Center on August 12th.

This year, blockchain technology is one of the primary themes of the iWeb conference. Developers from multiple tech industries gather there to discuss and share ideas about blockchain, and blockchain technology.

We are excited to announce one of our community developers Frozen,  was representing us at the convention. He had the opportunity while at the conference to, set up a booth, do some networking, generate interest in XDAG, as well as setting up a few mobile wallets and handing out some XDAG while he was there to a few lucky souls!!

#### XDAG Meetup
    
We are also pleased to announce we held our first XDAG development meetup in Beijing, China on August 11th. Some of the key discussion points were:
* The logic of XDAG
* Implementing mining through the Python language
* How to achieve DAG structure in XDAG
* Double spending processing and high TPS
* Current development status
* Progressing the roadmap and what the future holds for XDAG

The meeting ended with a Q&A session.
    
We are currently trying to implement Python XDAG to display the logic of XDAG, a few devs are going to join us to implement Golang XDAG, which development will be starting very soon. There will be three developers working on Golang XDAG with the goal to implement enhanced pool node functionality.

On this note Frozen has said that XDAG will be very busy over the next month or so with 7 activities for XDAG each weekend working up until the end of September in different cities. We will be sure to keep you all posted on these events! The convention was considered a success with a considerable turnout and with many conversations had on behalf of XDAG, as well as the XDAG Development meetup attended by Frozen.
