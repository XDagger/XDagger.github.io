This poll has been formed to determine if community funds, collected to the community address from voluntary pool fees, should be distributed to members of the community who have produced, created, or improved community resources which further grow Dagger or secure the XDAG network.
Rewards will be given for completed tasks such as:

* The creation and upkeep of the community website
* Improved miners, from improved CPU miners to new GPU miners
* Public outreach and support

This reward is intended for recipients who have publicly released their work, without a community benefit arrangement prior to close of this poll, such as from direct developer payments or bounties. This reward is not intended as payment for any future work, including but not limited to wallet improvement, website upkeep, or release of code after the close of this poll.

The community XDAG address of FQglVQtb60vQv2DOWEUL7yh3smtj7g1s contains the funds to be distributed. All collected funds are voluntary. At the time of this poll, the balance exceeds 113300 XDAG.

After finalization of this poll, a new yes/no poll will be created with a list of recipients, accomplishments, and reward values. Upon agreement with this first poll, and finalization of this second poll, payouts will commence.

Thank you for being a part of the community, and taking your time to respond to this poll.

Please take the time to reply to this new poll .
This one is about the use of  the community fund.==> [https://goo.gl/forms/KxEFzbZcE7njKse22](https://goo.gl/forms/KxEFzbZcE7njKse22)
