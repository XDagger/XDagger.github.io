The winner of the XDAG Block Explorer bounty was not difficult to determine, as only one participant shared his work publicly before the end of the contest.

Discord user @rubencm#5207 has publicly released his block-explorer, based on prior work by Cheatoshin0.

@rubencm's block-explorer is available at this address: http://b.xdagtalk.com/

Per bounty conditions, we would like to reward @rubencm#5207 as the winner of this bounty.

Cheatoshin0 will be awarded the second place reward, as without his work @rubencm#5207 wouldn’t have been able to create his explorer.

As there were no other submissions, the third price will be shared between the two winners.

Please have a look on the following, we reward the block explorer bounty.
