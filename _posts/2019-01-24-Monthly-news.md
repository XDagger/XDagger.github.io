In our goal to be present on as many social platforms as possible, we have decided to create a forum to interact with each other. You can find the forum at <http://forum.xdag.us/>

You can also find us at IRC: [chat.freenode.net #xdag](irc://chat.freenode.net/#xdag). For more information on how to connect, freenode has a [wiki entry detailing how to connect to freenode's IRC server. ](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat). 

You can also find the rest of our community's social platforms on our website. 

# Whitelist cleaning

Recently, as some pools in the whitelist are defunct and there has been no communication from their owners, we have decided to remove defunct pools from the whitelist in the following weeks. Pools that are no longer functioning will be removed. This ensures that the network will continue to function, and increase activity again with new interested people. 

As always, please remember to monitor your miners and payouts. If you have not received any mining profits, it might be the case that the pool is defunct. You can check the status of pools at <https://xdag.io/pools>
