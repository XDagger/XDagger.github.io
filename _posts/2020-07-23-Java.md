We're pleased to officially announce that XDAG has now been implemented in Java, which indeed is a great call for the community, more developer are needed to support this great cause in other to help simplify the difficulty of technology advancement.

# Why XDAG choose Java:

We want our community to experience something more different than C, we understand the power behind huge community support and we're committed to make bigger implementation.

Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

It is one of the most popular programming language in the world

It is easy to learn and simple to use

It also an open-source and its free

It is secure, fast and powerful

Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

The above are the reason why  we took advantage of the java version so our community can benefit. 

Lastly with the new implementation of XDAG in Java will call out for more developer to join our community. Together we can achieve a lot as a community project.
